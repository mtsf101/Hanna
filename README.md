Virtual assistant in python.

This is a very simple virtual assistant you can try to code on your own. It's not perfect by any means - I just started learning python a month ago - but it listens, takes your commands, and answers in some way. 

I think it's great as a first project, it has helped me understand the very very basics of python and get rid of some of the "fear" I had about learning to code. 

I'll be periodically undating the code as I keep working on it.
